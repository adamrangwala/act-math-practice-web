> "To promote readability, maintainability, and modular design, all source code files in this project are limited to a maximum of 200 lines. Complex logic should be broken down into smaller, single-responsibility functions and components."

> "The project will be migrated from JavaScript to TypeScript. This decision was made to leverage TypeScript's static typing, which helps catch errors early in the development process, improves code clarity, and enhances the developer experience with better autocompletion and refactoring support. This aligns with modern web development best practices and supports the goal of building a robust, maintainable application."

> "For naming conventions, all React components and classes will use **PascalCase** (e.g., `PracticeScreen`, `StatsCard`). This is a standard convention in the React ecosystem that helps visually distinguish component constructors from regular HTML tags and JavaScript functions."

> "The spaced repetition logic has been pivoted from a question-based model to a **concept-based (subcategory) model**. Instead of tracking progress on individual questions (like digital flashcards), the system will now track a user's mastery score for each mathematical subcategory (e.g., 'Pythagorean Theorem'). This allows the application to be a more effective learning tool by repeatedly testing concepts the user struggles with, using different questions each time. This approach is more flexible and better supports the goal of true concept mastery over rote memorization."

> "The subcategory taxonomy has been completely overhauled to be more granular, consistent, and pedagogically sound. The previous list was refined into a clear, de-duplicated set of specific mathematical skills. This architectural decision is critical for enabling advanced features, including effective targeted practice and insightful data visualizations for the user (e.g., the 'Priority Matrix' chart)."

> "The post-session summary screen has been redesigned to provide a more engaging and data-rich user experience, moving away from a simple table to a scannable, color-coded list. Key decisions include: 1) **Contextual Highlighting:** Each question row is given a light green or red background for immediate correct/incorrect feedback. 2) **Performance-Based Coloring:** The time spent on each question is color-coded (green, orange, red) to help users instantly identify questions that took too long. 3) **Clutter-Free Topic Display:** Subcategories are rendered as badges, with a tooltip to reveal the full list on hover, preventing visual clutter while keeping all information accessible. These changes are intended to make the summary more intuitive and actionable for the user."
