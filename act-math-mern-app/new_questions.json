    "solutionText": "<b>1. Understand the Mode:</b><br/>The mode is the value that appears most often in a data set. In this question, we are looking for the 'Customers at Table' value that has the highest 'Number of Tables' (its frequency).<br/><br/><b>2. Find the highest frequency:</b><br/>Looking at the 'Number of Tables' column, the highest frequency is 12.<br/><br/><b>3. Determine the mode:</b><br/>The value in the 'Customers at Table' column that corresponds to the highest frequency is the mode. The frequency of 12 corresponds to 2 customers at a table.<br/><br/>Therefore, the mode is 2.<br/><br/><b>Pro Tip:</b> A common trap is to choose the highest frequency itself (12) as the answer. Remember, the mode is the *data value* that occurs most often, not the frequency count.",
