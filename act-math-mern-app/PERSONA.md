# ACT Math Sprint: User Persona & Strategic Positioning

This document defines our target user, "Sarah," and outlines the strategic positioning of ACT Math Sprint. It serves as a guide for all product development, design, and marketing decisions, ensuring we build a focused, democratic, and engaging tool.

## 1. Our Target User: "The Focused Improver"

We are not building for every student. We are building for **Sarah**.

### **Who is Sarah?**

*   **Profile:** A motivated high school sophomore or junior from a middle or low-middle-class family. They are digitally savvy and comfortable with app-based learning.
*   **Goal:** To significantly improve her ACT composite score to get into her target universities and qualify for scholarships. College affordability is a major factor for her family.
*   **The Problem:** Her overall score is being dragged down by one specific section: Math.
    *   *Example Scores:* English: 32, Reading: 30, Science: 29, **Math: 23**.
*   **Frustration:** She knows exactly what she needs to work on, but traditional prep is too expensive or too boring. Private tutors are not a financial option, and massive "all-in-one" platforms feel like a chore and a poor value for her specific needs.

### **Sarah's Needs & Motivations:**

*   **Efficiency:** She has 15-20 minutes between school, homework, and extracurriculars. She needs a tool that fits her life.
*   **Focus:** She wants to get straight to the math without navigating sections she already excels in.
*   **Engagement:** Staring at a static PDF of questions is demoralizing. She is used to engaging, gamified experiences like Duolingo and wants a tool that makes learning feel less like a chore.
*   **Clarity:** She needs a clear, actionable guide on *what* to practice next to see the fastest improvement.
*   **Value:** Her family is budget-conscious. A $200+ subscription for a tool where she'll only use 25% of the content is not a viable option.

## 2. Competitive Landscape: UWorld (The "Goliath")

UWorld is a top-tier, comprehensive ACT prep platform. We do not compete with them on breadth; we compete on focus, philosophy, and accessibility.

*   **UWorld's Model:** The "Digital Textbook." It's a massive, self-directed library for long, intensive study sessions. It is the **Swiss Army Knife**.
*   **Our Model:** The "Gamified Daily Workout." It's a fun, guided tool for short, consistent, and high-impact practice. We are the **Scalpel**.

| Feature | UWorld (The Generalist) | ACT Math Sprint (The Specialist) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Scope** | All 4 ACT Sections | **Math Only** |
| **Philosophy** | Comprehensive Study Resource | **Gamified Habit Formation (Duolingo Model)** |
| **User Experience** | Can be overwhelming; information overload | Simple, guided, rewarding |
| **Key Feature** | Massive, realistic question bank | **The Priority Matrix:** an actionable guide |
| **Price Point** | Premium ($$$) Subscription | **Accessible** ($) One-Time or Freemium |

## 3. Our Strategic Differentiation & Value Proposition

We win by being the absolute best solution for Sarah. We differentiate ourselves on three core pillars:

### **Pillar 1: Niche Focus (Our Identity)**

*   **Value Prop:** The most efficient way to raise your ACT Math score.
*   **Marketing Message:** "Stop paying for sections you don't need. If Math is your weak spot, we're the specialists. We obsess over ACT Math so you don't have to."
*   **Key Features:** The Priority Matrix, granular sub-topic filtering, in-depth math-specific analytics.

### **Pillar 2: Gamification & Habit Formation (Our Philosophy)**

*   **Value Prop:** The Duolingo of ACT Math. Build a powerful study habit in just 15 minutes a day.
*   **Marketing Message:** "Finally, ACT prep that isn't a chore. Turn your spare moments into real points on your score with a fun, rewarding, and game-like experience."
*   **Key Features:** A core loop built around the Daily Practice session, prominent **Streak tracking**, achievements, points/leaderboards, and other gamification elements that make learning addictive and effective.

### **Pillar 3: Democratic Accessibility (Our Business Model)**

*   **Value Prop:** Premium math prep without the premium price. We believe every student deserves access to the best tools, regardless of their family's income.
*   **Marketing Message:** "Get unlimited, specialized math prep for less than the price of a single tutoring session. High-quality test prep is no longer a luxury."
*   **Key Features:** A robust free tier with a daily question limit, and a simple, affordable one-time purchase to unlock unlimited access. This is a direct challenge to the expensive, gatekept model of traditional prep.

By relentlessly focusing on **Sarah's** needs and executing on these three pillars, ACT Math Sprint will carve out a valuable and defensible niche in the test prep market.
